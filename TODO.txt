Things I'd like to demo

make picker event result in a text annotation
play with both 2D and 3D text annotation-- see vtk user guide section 4.11
[The 2D one is now done, but it would be nice to try 3D also]

make an assembly and set up an interactor to manipulate parts of the assembly by clicking on them
(will this need a custom interactor? IDK)

try making translucent actors and order them differently in the renderer's list of actors (i.e. add them in different orders)
the DepthSort example might be related to this

make a textured object

when creating a callback what's the difference between inheriting from
vtkCommand or inheriting from vtkCallbackCommand?

multiple renderers in one render window
(see listing 3.4 in vtk textbook for help)

use python bindings to write a python version of a demo you wrote
(this is good to know how to do for rapid prototyping!)

look at some exercises from 3.14 in vtk textbook

use a vtkFollower actor to make text (or something else) always face the camera
(see pdf page 79 of vtk UG)

make a 3D widget from the list on vtk UG pdf page 86, 87, 88

plot a quadric in 3 different ways, kind of like in fig 4.1(a) on p86 of VTK texbook
