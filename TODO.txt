Things I'd like to demo

make picker event result in a text annotation

make an assembly and set up an interactor to manipulate parts of the assembly by clicking on them
(will this need a custom interactor? IDK)

try making translucent actors and order them differently in the renderer's list of actors (i.e. add them in different orders)
the DepthSort example might be related to this

make a textured object
